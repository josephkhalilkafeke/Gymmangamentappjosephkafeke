Gym Management System –  Joseph Khalil Kafeke
This gym managemt project is a application built using .NET MAUI. I made it to help gym staff and managers organize their day-to-day work more efficiently, I workout alot so this was something I am the most familiar with, no more messy paper work or lost info.
What does it do?:
The app allows gym staff to:
• Add and manage gym members/staff
• Keep track of membership status
• Create and schedule workout classes
Why did I built it?:
Running a gym manually or on paper can get messy. This app makes things easier, faster, and more efficient. no more flipping through binders or forgetting who’s in what class.
Tools I used include:
• .NET MAUI 
• C# 
• MySQL/MariaDB 
• HeidiSQL
